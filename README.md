Portofolio

Html Portofolio page

Hello.

This is first attempt to commit  my Portofolio Project for grading.
I used bootstrap to create this. First time I used this tool, so I watched various videos with examples on youtube(I don't know if I should post a list). Also I read guides from the official page of bootstrap.

In addition to the videos and resources in HTML/INTRO I visited w3schools for css and html excercises and examples.
Also visited www.csstutorial.net


I hope i am not violating any "rules" of the project by using a carousel and not three separate "boxes" as in the mockup. 
I had big trouble getting the carousel element in my HTML(jquey or faulty bootstrap.min.js) so desperate I followed almost step by step the example on official site.
